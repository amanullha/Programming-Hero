HTML-4 Vs HTML-5

1. Semantic tag
    A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

    Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

    Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

sequence: header->nav
          main->section->ariticle
          footer
